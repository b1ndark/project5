### **MoSCoW prioritization method**

- The MoSCoW prioritization method was utilized for the project in order to achieve the goals.
- The MoSCoW categories:
  - Must-Have - They are guaranteed to be delivered as they are critical in order to success.
  - Should-Have - They do complement the project by adding value but vital for it to run, so they can be added in future.
  - Could-Have - If not implemented it will not affect the functionality, but could improve User/Customer experience.
  - Won't-Have - It is not a priority for this iteration.
  - For more info on MoSCoW method please click [here](https://monday.com/blog/project-management/moscow-prioritization-method/)
- I have created a Kanban using Github projects, the User story template and labels were created following [Code Institute](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+AG101+2021_T1/courseware/a4e548ca70a3473aa890ba2ab9bf612c/db69a5829de8467eb071e63bde630a2e/?child=last) and where in each user story I have added acceptance criteria and tasks that needed to be completed in order to close them. The Kanban can be found [here](https://github.com/users/b1ndark/projects/5/views/1).

## **Bugs**

- I found a bug when displaing the info in the footer, If I was in the about page, the info in footer would display with no issues but not in the other pages the info would be blank.

  - I had to create a contexts.py in about app, move the follow code from views.py to the contexts.py

  ```ruby
    from .models import About

    def about_contents(request):
        """
        To render the about info in every page footer
        """

        about = About.objects.first()

        context = {
            'about': about,
        }

        return context
  ```

  - and also had to add the following to the list of context processors in the templates variable in settings.py in order to render the context in every page footer.

  ```ruby
    'about.contexts.about_contents',
  ```

- After setting up send emails, when trying to signup I was getting a server timeout error ```SMTP.starttls() got an unexpected keyword argument 'keyfile'```, to fix this I did the following

  - I had to create a file named ```runtime.txt``` with ```python-3.9.16``` in it
  - After doing that I was getting another error but this time was when trying to deploy to Heroku which was failing. To fix it I had to downgrade the urllib3 from ```==2.0.7``` to ```==1.26.15```

- The navbar had a bug, the issue was when clicking on one of the menus to dropdown the choices, it would only show the choices when clicked a second time.

  - After researching about it I found that the issue was being caused by having a duplicate bootstrap.min.js file script as it was being called twice. So to fix it I deleted one of the scripts and now works fine.

35. Click **Download .csv file** as it contains the **Access key ID** and the **Secret access key** which you will need them to authenticate
36. Now back in your app you need to install both Boto3 ```pip3 install boto3``` and Django-storages ```pip3 install django-storages``` and make sure to freeze afterwards ```pip3 freeze > requirements.txt```
37. Now in setting add ```'django-storages',``` to the Installed apps, then still within the settings add the following
    ```ruby
    if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:
    # Cache control
    AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
        'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
        'CacheControl': 'max-age=94608000',
    }

    # Bucket Config
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'your bucket name'
    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'your account region'
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
    AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'

    # Static and media files
    STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
    STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
    DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
    MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'

    # Override static and media Urls in production
    STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
    MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'
    ```
38. In your app create a new file called "custom_storages.py" to tell django to use S3 to store static files when someone runs collectstatic and also to store any uploaded images, the custom_storages.py code is bellow
    ```ruby
    from django.conf import settings
    from storages.backends.s3boto3 import S3Boto3Storage


    class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
        location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION


    class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
        location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION

    ```
